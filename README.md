# AvidityMonteCarloIntegration
Multivalent Particle Binding Simulation - Scale 1

Welcome to the AvidityMonteCarloIntegration repository. This project focuses on estimating binding affinities (avidities) of multivalent particles and receptors using a Monte Carlo (MC) integration approach. The model extends the work of Liese and Netz to account for non-identical linker lengths and binding affinities and it has been used in "Evolution of Multivalent Supramolecular Assemblies of Functionalized Nucleic Acids with User-Defined Spatial Organization".

## About

This repository contains scripts for:

    Estimating the weights of binding modes across a multidimensional parameter space.

Current Status

This is the initial commit of the project. Comprehensive descriptions, usage instructions, and examples will be provided in upcoming updates.
Planned Updates

Future updates will include:

    Detailed documentation of the methodology.
    Example scripts with parameter configurations.
    Instructions for replicating simulations.
    Visualizations of results.

Getting Started

For now, this repository serves as a foundation for the simulation model. Stay tuned for additional resources and updates.
